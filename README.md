# **Cricket Field Strategizer**



#### This is a project creates for all Cricketers, especially captains who would like to envision a certain scenario for an upcoming match.



Say Shubhman Gill wants to envision what field he would like if Bumrah is bowling to Joe Root. He can choose whether it is an attacking/defensive/standard field, along with the match format. Most importantly, he can name all the players so that it feels like a proper simulation. Finally, Scenario Notes can be added as well for the ease of others' understanding. He can name the field placement too!

All of this, combined in a sidebar with an interactive field canvas with draggable players.

But once you click on download? That is the best part.

It downloads a PNG or JPEG (Basis your choice) with only and only the cricket field showing with the fielders.

#### Additionally, remember all the match conditions you had set in the sidebar? They all show up in the image in a compact and easy to read way so that sharing is the simplest thing in the world.

It all comes out looking like this:
